### A simple flask-based web translator for natural languages, using the Python google trans library

**After cloning this repository, launch the translator in your browser via the command line by following these steps:** 
1. Navigate into the top level directory of this repository.
2. Use command *python app.py*. This runs the flask server. 
3. Open your favourite browser and navigate to localhost:5000 **or** 127.0.0.1:5000
4. Try some translations!

**Note:** the googletrans library seems to mostly translate correctly, however, it did make mistakes during my testing of the application.
