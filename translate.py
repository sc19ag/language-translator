# Here, I need to pass the input text from the user input, in the html, to the translate() function AND ensure the 
# src and dest language parameters of the translate() function match that of the drop-down boxes in the html document
# The returned value, translated, will need to converted back to json and saved into a different json file to the input json file from 
# the js file.
